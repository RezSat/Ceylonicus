## Note: This is just a pet project that I work on for fun and learning purposes.

### Download Iskoola Pota font from here: [Iskoola Pota](https://freefontsdownload.net/free-iskpotab-font-145700.htm)

## How to Run

### Method - 1
Tested Python Versions are 3.8.6 and 3.6.8,
Clone this repo and run `IDE.py`, which is a simple GUI to run the Ceylonicus Source Code. Make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed.

### Method - 2
Simple, Just use the executable from the latest release. (Works only on Windows Platform)
command : ``` {excutable_path} {filename_with_extension}```
command example: ``` ceylonicus.exe test.cyl ```

## Examples can be Found inside the examples folder.

### I'm Working On:
```
[+] A Brython implementation, so this can be run directly on the browser.
[+] Make a Good IDE UI with more functions
[+] Make it work on Linux/Mac without python (as an direct executable).
[+] A Good Documentation for both contributions & learning.
```
