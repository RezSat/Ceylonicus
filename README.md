### Ceylonicus is the first written programming language that support syntaxes from sinhala language. Coded just for fun :) . 

```
Please note that `Invalid Syntax: Token cannot appear after previous tokens` is a well-known error (even if the syntax is correct) and that occurs due to Sinhala Unicode errors, 
due to this specific reason I recommend just simply using the web ide to run the code : 

[Ceylonicus Web IDE](https://ceylonicus.vercel.app/),until this error is fully fixed. 

Download and Install Iskoola Pota font(only if you are running the IDE.py) from here: 
[Iskoola Pota](https://freefontsdownload.net/free-iskpotab-font-145700.htm)

```

## How to Run

### Method - 1
Clone this repo and run `IDE.py`, which is a simple GUI to run the Ceylonicus Source Code. Make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed,
or use `main.py`. Command when using `main.py` is `python main.py filename.cyl`. (use the appropriate python command according to your os)

### Method - 2
Simple, Just use the executable from the latest release. (Works only on Windows Platform)
command : ``` {excutable_path} {filename_with_extension}```
command example: ``` ceylonicus.exe test.cyl ```

### Method - 3
The Newest method, just go to [Ceylonicus Web IDE](https://ceylonicus.vercel.app/) and run it on the browser (this is possible thanks to brython.)
