## How to Run

## Method - 1
Tested Python Versions are 3.8.6 and 3.6.8,
Clone this repo and run `IDE.py`, which is a simple GUI to run the Coord Source Code. Make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed.

## Method - 2
Simple, Just use the executable from the latest release. (Works only on Windows Platform)

## Examples can be Found inside the examples folder.

## I'm Working On:
```
[+] Make a Good UI with more functions
[+] Make it work on Linux/Mac without (as an direct executable).
[+] A Good Documentation
```
