# Coord-Programming-Language
Coord (Just a Random Name) is a Bilingual Programming Language, which support English &amp; Sinhala. It's the First ever built Sinhala Programming Language as well. Made for Fun, if you like please try to contribute :)

## How to Run

## Method - 1
Tested Python Versions are 3.8.6 and 3.6.8,
Clone this repo and run `IDE.py`, which is a simple GUI to run the Coord Source Code. Make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed.

## Method - 2
Simple, Just use the executable from the latest release. (Works only on Windows Platform)

## Examples can be Found inside the examples folder.

## I'm Working On:
```
[+] Make a Good UI
[+] Make it work on Windows/Linux/Mac without python installed (an executable).
[+] A Good Documentation
```
