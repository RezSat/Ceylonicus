### Ceylonicus is the first written programming language that support syntax from sinhala language. (It's more of a prototype/model language) 
[Ceylonicus Web IDE](https://ceylonicus.vercel.app/)

The Ceylonicus programming language draws its name from [Bungarus ceylonicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungarus_ceylonicus), a species of venomous elapid snake endemic to the island of Sri Lanka. This name also subtly acknowledges that the language was prototyped using Python.

## How to Run

### Method - 1
Clone this repo and run `IDE.py`, which is a simple GUI to run the Ceylonicus Source Code. Make sure you have python and pyqt5 installed,
or use `main.py`. Command when using `main.py` is `python main.py filename.cyl`. (use the appropriate python command according to your os)

### Method - 2
Simple, Just use the executable from the latest release. (Works only on Windows Platform)
command : ``` {excutable_path} {filename_with_extension}```
command example: ``` ceylonicus.exe test.cyl ```

### Method - 3
The Newest method, just go to [Ceylonicus Web IDE](https://ceylonicus.vercel.app/) and run it on the browser (this is possible thanks to brython.)
